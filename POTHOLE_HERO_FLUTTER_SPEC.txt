Pothole Hero - Mobile App Specification (React Native / Expo)

1. Project Overview
   - Goal: Create a native mobile application (iOS & Android) for Pothole Hero using React Native (Expo).
   - Core Value: Native performance with maximum code reusability (~70%) from the existing React web application.
   - Synchronization: This app will connect to the SAME Supabase backend as the website, ensuring real-time data consistency across web and mobile.

2. Selected Tech Stack (React Native Ecosystem)

   A. Core Framework
      - Framework: React Native (via Expo)
      - Tooling: Expo Router (File-based routing, similar to Next.js/Vite structure)
      - Language: TypeScript (Shared types with web)
      - IDE: VS Code

   B. Backend & Database (Shared Backend)
      *Sharing data with your existing React website.*
      - Service: Supabase
      - SDK: `@supabase/supabase-js` (Same SDK as web!)
      - Auth: Supabase Auth
      - Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
      - Storage: Supabase Storage (for images)

   C. Key Libraries & Packages
      - Styling: `nativewind` (Tailwind CSS for React Native - reuse your web classes)
      - State Management: `@tanstack/react-query` (Reuse your web queries/mutations)
      - Maps: `react-native-maps` (Standard for RN)
      - Location: `expo-location`
      - Camera/Gallery: `expo-image-picker`
      - Icons: `lucide-react-native`
      - UI Components: Build custom components using NativeWind or adapt `react-native-reusables` (shadcn/ui port for RN).

3. Mobile-Specific Features
   - Offline Mode: Cache reports locally using `@tanstack/react-query` persistence or `AsyncStorage`.
   - Haptic Feedback: `expo-haptics` for tactile response on interactions.
   - Deep Linking: Open specific reports directly from shared links.
   - Native Gestures: Swipe-to-delete, pinch-to-zoom.

4. UI/UX Adaptation for Mobile
   - Navigation: Tab Bar navigation (Home, Map, Settings) using Expo Router.
   - Layout: SafeAreaView handling for notches/dynamic islands.
   - Components: Adapt web components to use `<View>` and `<Text>` instead of `<div>` and `<span>`.

5. Implementation Roadmap

   Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
   - Initialize Expo project: `npx create-expo-app@latest`
   - Setup NativeWind (Tailwind CSS).
   - Copy `types/` folder from web project (Shared interfaces).
   - Configure Supabase client (Reuse logic).

   Phase 2: Core Reporting Flow
   - Implement Camera screen (Image Picker).
   - Implement Map screen (Location selection).
   - Create Submission Form (Reuse form logic/validation).

   Phase 3: Dashboard & Viewing
   - Create "Recent Reports" list view.
   - Implement Report Details screen.
   - Add "My Reports" filter.

   Phase 4: Polish & Deploy
   - Add Splash Screen.
   - Configure App Icons.
   - Build for EAS (Expo Application Services) or local Android/iOS builds.

6. Database Schema (Supabase - Same as Web)
   *Reuse the existing 'pothole_reports' table.*
   - id: uuid
   - image_url: text
   - latitude: float8
   - longitude: float8
   - address: text
   - area_name: text
   - duration: text
   - status: text
