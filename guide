⚠️ Critical Next Step: Rebuild the APK
For the "updates" functionality to work, the native app code needs to know how to fetch them. You must rebuild and reinstall the APK one last time.

Run this command in your terminal to generate the new APK:


powershell


npx eas build --platform android --profile preview


How to Push Future Changes
Once you have installed the new APK on your phone, you won't need to reinstall it for JavaScript/styling changes. Instead, you can push updates directly to it:

Make your changes in the code.
Publish the update by running:
powershell


npx eas update --branch preview --message "Description of your changes"


(Note: This targets the preview channel we configured in 
eas.json
).
The next time you open the app on your phone (or restart it), it will download the new version and update itself.
